Fabricate includes 9 templates that give you a fully working starting point. Instead of describing your entire app from scratch, pick the template closest to what you want and customize from there.

<Tip>
  Templates use the full Fabricate tech stack: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4, Hono.js, Cloudflare D1. Every template is production-grade, not a toy example.

## Templates vs. Starting from Scratch

| | Template | Scratch |
|---|---|---|
| **Speed to first working app** | Minutes | Minutes |
| **Best for** | Common app patterns | Unique concepts |
| **Customization** | Full | Full |
| **Credit usage** | Similar | Similar |

Both approaches generate the same quality of code. Templates just give you more to start with.
