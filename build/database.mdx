description: "Fabricate apps use Cloudflare D1 — a serverless SQLite database that's globally distributed and automatically managed."
---

Every Fabricate app comes with a Cloudflare D1 database. D1 is built on SQLite, globally distributed on Cloudflare's edge network, and requires zero configuration from you.

## How It Works

When you build an app with Fabricate, the AI automatically:

- **Designs your database schema** based on what your app needs
- **Generates migrations** to create and modify tables
- **Writes database queries** in your API routes
- **Updates the schema** when you add new features that need new tables or columns

You don't write SQL. You describe what you need and the AI handles the database.

## Example

```
Prompt: "Add a comments system to the blog. Each comment should have the 
         author's name, email, content, and timestamp."
```

Fabricate will:
1. Add a `comments` table to your D1 schema
2. Create a migration to add the table
3. Add API routes to create, read, and delete comments
4. Update the frontend to display comments on blog posts

## Schema Example

A typical Fabricate app database might look like:

```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Sessions table
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  expires_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Your app's custom tables
CREATE TABLE projects (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## Data Access

D1 data is accessed from your Hono.js API routes using the D1 binding. Fabricate generates these routes for you. Example:

```typescript
app.get('/api/projects', async (c) => {
  const userId = c.get('userId'); // from auth middleware
  const projects = await c.env.DB.prepare(
    'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC'
  ).bind(userId).all();
  return c.json(projects.results);
});
```

## Limitations

<Info>
  D1 is SQLite-based. It's great for most web apps, but if you need advanced PostgreSQL features (like complex JSON operations, full-text search, or very high write throughput), consider using an external database and syncing via GitHub.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I see my database data?">
    You can view and query your D1 database through the Cloudflare dashboard. Your data is stored securely on Cloudflare's infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import existing data?">
    Yes. Tell Fabricate you want to seed your database with initial data, or describe the data import you need — it will generate a migration or seeding script.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my data if I switch plans?">
    Your data persists regardless of plan changes. It's stored on Cloudflare's infrastructure and is not affected by your Fabricate subscription.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add indexes for performance?">
    Yes. Ask Fabricate to add database indexes: "Add an index on the projects table for user_id to speed up user project queries."
