Discuss Mode is always free. Switch to it any time you want to think through your app, ask questions, or get advice without worrying about credit usage.

<Info>
  Discuss Mode uses the same Claude AI as Build Mode — it just doesn't modify your code. It's like having a senior developer on call for free.

## When to Use Discuss Mode

- **Before building a complex feature** — plan the approach before writing any code
- **When you're stuck** — describe the problem and ask for suggestions
- **To understand your code** — "What does this API route do?" or "How is authentication currently set up?"
- **For product decisions** — "Should I use a modal or a separate page for this form?"
- **To estimate complexity** — "How hard would it be to add real-time notifications?"

## Example Conversations

### Planning a Feature
```
You: I want to add a team collaboration feature. Users should be able to invite others 
     to their workspace and assign roles. How should I structure this?

Fabricate: Good question. For a team workspace system, you'll want...
```

### Understanding Your Code
```
You: What does the /api/auth/session route do exactly?

Fabricate: That route handles session validation. It reads the session token 
           from the cookie, checks it against the sessions table in D1...
```

### Getting Architecture Advice
```
You: Should I store user preferences in the database or in localStorage?

Fabricate: It depends on whether preferences need to sync across devices...
```

## Switching Between Modes

Toggle between Build Mode and Discuss Mode using the mode selector in the chat panel. Your conversation history is preserved when you switch.

<Tip>
  A common pattern: use Discuss Mode to plan your next 3-5 features, get Fabricate's recommendations on ordering and approach, then switch to Build Mode to execute them one by one.

## What Discuss Mode Can't Do

Discuss Mode cannot make changes to your code. It can provide instructions, write code snippets as suggestions, and explain concepts — but to actually modify your app, you need to switch to Build Mode.
