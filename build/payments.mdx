title: "Payments"
description: "Add Stripe payments to your app — subscriptions, one-time payments, and billing management — all generated by AI."
---

Fabricate can add complete Stripe payment integrations to your app. Just describe the billing model you want, and the AI generates the full implementation.

<Warning>
  You'll need a Stripe account and API keys. Add your keys as environment secrets after Fabricate generates the payment code. See [Environment Secrets](/build/environment-secrets).
</Warning>

## Adding Payments

```
"Add Stripe subscription billing with monthly and annual plans:
- Basic: $9/month
- Pro: $29/month  
- Add a billing page where users can manage their subscription"
```

Or for one-time payments:

```
"Add a one-time payment flow — users pay $49 to unlock premium features permanently"
```

## What Gets Generated

**Stripe integration:**
- Stripe SDK configuration
- Price IDs mapped to your plan names
- Checkout session creation
- Webhook handler for payment events

**Database updates:**
- Subscription status stored on user records
- Payment history table (if requested)

**API routes:**
- `POST /api/billing/checkout` — creates Stripe checkout session
- `POST /api/billing/portal` — opens Stripe customer portal
- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` — handles Stripe webhook events

**Frontend:**
- Pricing page with plan comparison
- Checkout flow with Stripe redirect
- Billing portal link for subscription management
- Subscription status gates for premium features

## Subscription Patterns

### Monthly/Annual Plans
```
"Add Pro ($19/mo or $190/yr) and Team ($49/mo or $490/yr) subscription tiers with annual discount"
```

### Per-Seat Pricing
```
"Add usage-based billing — $10 per user per month, manage seats from the account settings"
```

### Freemium with Upgrade
```
"Add a premium upgrade button. Free users get 3 projects, paid users ($12/month) get unlimited"
```

## Setting Up Your Stripe Keys

  <Step title="Add keys as environment secrets">
    In Fabricate's Build settings, add:

    - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — your webhook signing secret
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up webhooks in Stripe">
    In Stripe, add a webhook endpoint pointing to `https://your-app.fabricate.app/api/webhooks/stripe`.
    Listen for: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`.
