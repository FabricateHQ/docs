Authentication is one of the most common things people ask Fabricate to build. Just describe the auth flow you want, and Fabricate generates the complete implementation — frontend forms, API routes, session management, and database schema.

## Adding Authentication

Just ask:

```
"Add user authentication with email and password sign up and login"
```

Or be more specific:

```
"Add authentication with:
- Email/password sign up with email verification
- Login with remember me option
- Password reset via email
- Protected routes that redirect to login if not authenticated"
```

## What Gets Generated

When you add authentication, Fabricate creates:

**Database tables:**
- `users` — stores user accounts
- `sessions` — manages login sessions
- `password_reset_tokens` — for password recovery (if requested)

**API routes:**
- `POST /api/auth/signup` — create account
- `POST /api/auth/login` — authenticate and create session
- `POST /api/auth/logout` — destroy session
- `GET /api/auth/session` — check current auth state
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` — initiate password reset (if requested)

**Frontend:**
- Login page with form validation
- Sign up page with error handling
- Auth context/provider for state management
- Protected route wrapper component
- User menu with logout button

## Auth Patterns

### Email + Password (Default)
The most common pattern. Secure, uses bcrypt for password hashing, session tokens in cookies.

### Social Login
```
"Add Google login alongside the existing email/password auth"
```

### Magic Link
```
"Replace the password flow with magic link authentication — users enter their email 
and get a login link sent to them"
```

## Security Best Practices

Fabricate's generated auth code follows security best practices:

- Passwords hashed with **bcrypt** (not stored in plain text)
- Session tokens are **cryptographically random** UUIDs
- Sessions stored **server-side** in D1 (not just in a JWT)
- **HttpOnly, Secure** cookies to prevent XSS theft
- Input validation on all auth endpoints

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add roles and permissions?">
    Yes. Ask Fabricate to add roles: "Add admin and user roles. Admins can access the /admin dashboard, regular users cannot."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I require email verification?">
    Yes: "Add email verification — users must verify their email before they can log in."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I want OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.)?">
    Ask Fabricate to add the specific OAuth provider you want. It will generate the OAuth flow, callback routes, and database updates needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are sessions stored?">
    Sessions are stored in your Cloudflare D1 database. The session ID is stored in an HttpOnly cookie on the user's browser.
