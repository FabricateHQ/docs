description: "Everything you need to know about building apps with Fabricate."
---

The Build section covers everything inside the Fabricate editor — how code gets generated, how the two modes work, how to manage your tech stack, and how to get your code in and out of Fabricate.

## The Editor

The Fabricate editor is where your app comes to life. It has three key areas:

- **Chat panel** — where you talk to the AI (Build Mode or Discuss Mode)
- **Preview panel** — a live, interactive preview of your app
- **File Explorer** — view and navigate your app's file structure

## Two Modes

  <Card title="Build Mode" icon="hammer" href="/build/build-mode">
    Send a message and Fabricate generates or modifies your code in real time. Uses credits. This is where your app gets built.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discuss Mode" icon="message-circle" href="/build/discuss-mode">
    Free, unlimited conversations with the AI. Plan features, ask questions, understand your code — no credits used.
