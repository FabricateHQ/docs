Fabricate is designed to remove the barrier between having an idea and having a working app. Whether you've never written a line of code or you're a senior engineer who wants to move faster, Fabricate fits your workflow.

## The Six Personas

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Non-Technical Founders" icon="lightbulb">
    You have a product vision but not the engineering background to build it. Fabricate gives you the ability to go from idea to working prototype in hours — not months. Validate your concept, show investors a working demo, and iterate without waiting for a dev team.

    **Perfect for:** MVP development, investor demos, product validation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Indie Hackers & Bootstrappers" icon="rocket">
    You ship fast and own your work. Fabricate accelerates your build cycle dramatically. Generate the boilerplate, the CRUD operations, the auth flow — and spend your time on the parts that make your product unique.

    **Perfect for:** SaaS products, side projects, revenue-generating apps
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Designers & Product Managers" icon="pen-tool">
    Bring your wireframes and product specs to life without depending on an engineering backlog. Build interactive prototypes, test user flows, and hand off working code — not static mockups.

    **Perfect for:** Prototyping, user testing, design-to-code workflows
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Professional Developers" icon="code">
    Use Fabricate to scaffold new projects in seconds, generate boilerplate you'd rather not write, and accelerate feature development. Export the code, push to your own repo, and take it wherever you need.

    **Perfect for:** Rapid prototyping, client projects, internal tools
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agency Teams" icon="users">
    Deliver client projects faster with Fabricate's structured output. Generate consistent, well-architected code. Use GitHub sync to integrate with existing workflows. Reduce time-to-demo without sacrificing quality.

    **Perfect for:** Client sites, internal dashboards, rapid delivery
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Students & Learners" icon="graduation-cap">
    See how real full-stack apps are structured. Build projects for your portfolio. Learn by reading and modifying the code Fabricate generates. Free plan gives you 60 credits per month to experiment.
