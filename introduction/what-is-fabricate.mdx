Fabricate is an AI app builder powered by [Claude](https://anthropic.com/claude). You describe what you want to build — in plain language — and Fabricate generates a complete, deployable full-stack application. No coding experience required, but developers love it too.

## The Full Stack, Handled

Every Fabricate app comes with a production-ready architecture out of the box:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Frontend" icon="monitor">
    React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui. Beautiful, modern UI components ready to customize.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend" icon="server">
    Hono.js API routes running on Cloudflare Workers. Fast, globally distributed, and serverless.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Database" icon="database">
    Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with auto-generated schema and migrations. Your data, your control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deployment" icon="globe">
    Instant deployment to Cloudflare's global edge network. Live in seconds, not hours.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Two Modes, One Workflow

Fabricate has two distinct modes that work together:

**Build Mode** is where code gets written. Every message you send in Build Mode uses credits and generates or modifies your app's code. Use it when you're ready to make changes.

**Discuss Mode** is free. Use it to plan your app, ask questions, brainstorm features, or get advice — without spending any credits. It's like having a senior developer available 24/7.

## Powered by Claude

Fabricate uses Anthropic's Claude as its AI engine:

- **Free & Pro plans** — Claude Sonnet for fast, capable code generation
- **Scale plan** — Claude Opus for the most complex apps and nuanced requirements

The AI understands your entire codebase at once, can work with 32 specialized tools, and generates code that follows best practices automatically.

## Built for Real Apps

Fabricate isn't just for prototypes. Apps built with Fabricate include:

- Full user authentication flows
- Stripe payment integrations
- Real database with relationships and migrations
- Secure API routes with proper error handling
- Responsive, accessible UI
- GitHub sync for version control

## How It's Different

Unlike no-code tools, Fabricate generates real code you own. Unlike starting from scratch, you go from idea to working app in minutes. You can export your code at any time, sync it to GitHub, and deploy it anywhere.

<Tip>
  Fabricate is most powerful when you're specific. "Build a SaaS app for tracking freelance invoices with Stripe payments and a dashboard" will get you much further than "build an invoice app."
