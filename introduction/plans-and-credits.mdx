Fabricate uses a credit-based system. Credits are consumed when you send messages in **Build Mode**. **Discuss Mode is always free** — use it as much as you like.

## Plans

| Feature | Free | Pro | Scale |
|---------|------|-----|-------|
| **Monthly Price** | $0 | $25/mo | $50/mo |
| **Credits/Month** | 60 | 350 | 700 |
| **AI Model** | Claude Sonnet | Claude Sonnet | Claude Opus |
| **Custom Domains** | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| **GitHub Sync** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Private Apps** | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| **Priority Support** | — | — | ✓ |

<Info>
  All plans include unlimited Discuss Mode messages. Credits are only used in Build Mode.

## How Credits Work

Credits are a measure of AI computation. The more complex your request, the more tokens are processed — and the more credits are used.

**The formula:**

```
Credits used = Total tokens processed / TOKENS_PER_CREDIT
TOKENS_PER_CREDIT = 10,000
```

Tokens include both the input (your message + the app context Fabricate reads) and the output (the code Fabricate writes).

### What Uses More Credits?

- **Large apps** — more existing code = more context tokens read
- **Complex changes** — touching many files at once
- **Long responses** — generating large blocks of new code

### What Uses Fewer Credits?

- **Targeted changes** — "only change the button color on the home page"
- **Early in a project** — less code context to read
- **Discuss Mode** — completely free, no credits used

## Credit Examples

| Action | Approximate Credits |
|--------|-------------------|
| First prompt (new app) | 3–8 credits |
| Small UI change | 1–3 credits |
| Adding a new feature | 3–10 credits |
| Major refactor | 8–20 credits |
| Complex multi-file change | 10–25 credits |

<Warning>
  These are estimates. Actual credit usage depends on your app's current size and the complexity of your request.
