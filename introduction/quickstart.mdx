<Info>
  You don't need to install anything. Fabricate runs entirely in your browser.
</Info>

## 1. Create Your Account

Go to [fabricate.build](https://fabricate.build) and sign up. The Free plan gives you **60 credits per month** — no credit card required.

## 2. Describe Your App

In the prompt box on the home screen, describe what you want to build. Be as specific as you can.

<Tip>
  **Good prompt example:** "Build a task management app for freelancers with a project board, time tracking, and invoice generation. Include user authentication and a dashboard showing hours worked per client."

  The more detail you provide, the better your starting point will be.
</Tip>

## 3. Watch It Build

Fabricate will generate your complete app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generating your app structure">
    Fabricate plans the architecture, components, and file structure for your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Writing the code">
    React components, TypeScript types, API routes, database schema — all generated simultaneously.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setting up the database">
    Your Cloudflare D1 database is initialized with the right tables and relationships.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview ready">
    Your app appears in the live preview panel. Click around — it's fully functional.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Iterate with Build Mode

The app Fabricate generates is your starting point. Use the chat to make changes:

- "Add a dark mode toggle"
- "Make the navbar sticky"
- "Add a search bar to the projects list"
- "Change the primary color to blue"

Each message you send in **Build Mode** uses credits and updates your app in real time.

## 5. Switch to Discuss Mode (Free)

Hit the **Discuss** button to switch to Discuss Mode. This is free — no credits used. Use it to:

- Plan your next set of features
- Ask "how should I structure this?"
- Get advice on your product direction
- Understand what the generated code does

## 6. Deploy Your App

When you're ready to share your app:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Deploy">
    Hit the **Deploy** button in the top right of the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your URL">
    Your app is live instantly on Cloudflare's global network. You'll get a `yourapp.fabricate.app` URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a custom domain (optional)">
    On Pro and Scale plans, connect your own domain in the Deploy settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
