<Info>
  **Build Anything, Ship Faster.** Fabricate turns your ideas into production-ready full-stack apps using AI — powered by Claude, deployed on Cloudflare.
</Info>

Fabricate is an AI-powered app builder that takes your idea from prompt to deployed product. Describe what you want to build, and Fabricate generates a complete React + TypeScript + Tailwind app — with a real database, authentication, payments, and more — all running on Cloudflare's global edge network.
